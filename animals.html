                <h2>Arctic Fox</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Arctic Fox</strong> is a small mammal native to the Arctic regions of the Northern Hemisphere, including Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Siberia. 
                    Known for its thick fur coat that changes color with the seasons (white in winter and brown-gray in summer), the Arctic fox is well-adapted to survive in extreme cold and snowy environments. 
                    It has a rounded body shape, short ears, and a bushy tail that helps it conserve body heat. 
                    Arctic foxes are opportunistic feeders, hunting small mammals, birds, fish, and scavenging on carrion and plant matter when available. 
                    These foxes are known for their intelligence and ability to survive in harsh conditions, digging dens in the snow to shelter themselves and their young. 
                    Climate change and habitat loss due to human activities pose significant threats to Arctic fox populations, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.

                <h2>Polar Bear</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Polar Bear</strong> is a large carnivorous mammal native to the Arctic regions surrounding the North Pole, including parts of Canada, Alaska, Russia, Greenland, and Norway. 
                    Known for its distinctive white fur, the polar bear is perfectly adapted to its icy habitat, using its thick coat and layer of blubber to stay warm in freezing temperatures. 
                    Polar bears are powerful swimmers and adept hunters, primarily preying on seals that they catch from sea ice platforms. 
                    These apex predators play a crucial role in Arctic ecosystems, regulating seal populations and contributing to biodiversity. 
                    Climate change poses a significant threat to polar bears, as melting sea ice reduces their hunting grounds and access to prey, leading to declining populations and challenges for their conservation. 
                    Conservation efforts are crucial to protecting these iconic Arctic animals and their fragile habitat.

                <h2>Snowy Owl</h2>
                <p>
                    The <strong>Snowy Owl</strong> is a majestic bird of prey found in the Arctic tundra regions of North America, Europe, and Asia. 
                    Known for its striking white plumage with dark bars and yellow eyes, the Snowy Owl is well-adapted to its cold and snowy habitat. 
                    It has a robust body, large wingspan, and keen eyesight, making it an efficient hunter of small mammals like lemmings, voles, and birds. 
                    Snowy owls are nomadic birds, often migrating southward in search of food during harsh Arctic winters. 
                    These owls nest on the ground, typically on elevated mounds or rocky outcrops, and are known for their resilience in extreme weather conditions. 
                    Conservation efforts focus on protecting their breeding grounds and wintering habitats to ensure the survival of this iconic Arctic bird species.
